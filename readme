Create a database called 'publications'.
This database will have two tables called 'authors' and 'titles'.

Table 'authors' will have following schema:
 
+---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(120) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| email   | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| country | varchar(30)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

 
Table 'titles' will have following schema:
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name  | varchar(120) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| title | varchar(120) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| year  | smallint(6)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
 
 
Write a PHP program in which you communicate with this database 
and have following functionalities:

1.1) Display all the records in both the tables.
1.2) Adding a record (available for both the tables).
1.3) Deleting a record (available for both the tables).
1.4) Updating year of publication.  
1.5) Given a book find its author and year of publication.
     It might be possible that user might submit a substring in the book.

1.6) Given an year -- list the books published in that year and 
                      display total number of such books also.

1.7) Given a country-- find all the books (names of the books) 
     which authors from that country have published, publication year.
     ( i.e., country wise listing of books, authors along with publication year).

You can start with "connect.php" which will connect you to the database.

OR

The main php is "index.php". You can start from there as well.

Rest is user friendly. You can click on the buttons and find out.
